# HexLimited
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This GitHub repository only serves to fill Siege's required repository link, and was requested by Olive. Please review either the Onshape document listed below or the Printables demo. Don't rate me awful because woaw 2 commits! The description is also on Printables and is only here for the sake of clarity.

## Document
For those interested in seeing how each part went together, here is the public Onshape document:

https://cad.onshape.com/documents/d6b68908a59743b466c6f372/w/9c9fcc9cab55a80a33711ccc/e/292f1b5faa67b05ee287471c

Versioning shouldn't be necessary, just drag the "Rollback bar" up in the feature list sidebar to see how each part went together.

Additionally, the Printables page:

### What is it?
In reality? It's a bunch of hexagons on a grid that you can slot things into. In theory? It's a fully fledged storage framework. I've included some basic modules, but if you wanted to make your own, you're entirely allowed to, provided you keep the same license.

### Why use this?
Because hexagons are the bestagons.

TLDW:
Hexagons are the only shape that tesselate without dividing themselves to infinity. Squares and triangles all work by infinitely extending lines.
Sure, that's very sensible and definitely the best shape to use for a tiling storage system if you want it to be practical, but who cares about that sort of thing?
Instead of having a storage system that tiles easily and can create multiple-tile modules that just drop in and can fit any size of item, you can now have none of that but with slightly cooler hexagons!

In reality, this system isn't really suited for anything Zack Freedman's Gridfinity promises. If you want something practical, go use his system - it's far more fully fledged.
But if you're looking for some neat hexes, go ahead and print it out.

TLDR:
It sucks but it looks neat

### Print settings
- PLA will work, if you want something for the garage or whatever ABS/ASA might work nicely. Fine tune to your machine.
- I recommend using a 0.4mm nozzle for any of these parts.
- Print at 0.2mm layer height or finer, 3 perimeters.
- 1 bottom shell will be enough, but use 2 or 3 top shells.
- Using brim on tray parts may cause them to fit poorly.
- Use Grid or Rectilinear infill for a nicer finish. I don't recommend ironing. Gyroid or others will work too if you like the look of them.
- You'll want to print the trays slowly to avoid the corners curling up and get a nicer finish, especially using ABS/ASA.

### Reuse
Provided you give credit to me as the original creator, you may make any modifications or new tiles for the system. Please share it using the GNU GPL v3.0 license to perpetuate this.
Additionally, I'd be willing to model new tiles as long as more than 4 people can take benefit from the existence of said model.

### Contact
If you'd like to ask questions or request a new tile, you may DM me on Discord - `@_qwikster`.
You can try to leave a make with questions, but I might not see it until you've moved on to better uses of your time.

### Caveats
You may need to reorient parts to get them to print properly. No parts should need supports out of the base set - be sensible with settings.
Be aware that my printer has difficult tolerances and yours may as well - some of these require good fits, and I've biased to loose. You may need to add material or warp the material you have to get it to properly fit.
I don't claim any of the things Zack Freedman and his Gridfinity system create or promote. While this project is inspired from it, they are two separate entities and I have no relation to that project. I have no clue what I'm doing with licenses or anything legal.
As an amateur CAD designer, I don't claim that this is any good, and you SHOULD NOT attempt to learn from what I'm doing.

### Why was this made?
https://hack.club runs many programs, and the theme "Framework" this week on the one I'm participating in prompted me to get into CAD again. (This fits the theme, right?)
For anyone seeing it from there, vote 5* :)
